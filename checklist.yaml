        defined below explained in the method section? Note that additional information
        such as software setting should be reported - this will be addressed in the paper,
        however will not be assessed this in this question.

    title: >
        Does the paper include any images that were processed by methods other than cropping
        (i.e. processing using suites such as ImageJ, FIJI, Matlab with standard plug-ins)?
        We will use this question to flag papers with more complex image processing methods -
        if there are enough papers, image experts on our team will evaluate the description of
        the processing methods, pipelines, etc.
