  for details </h4> </br>

  For the purpose of this paper we consider the following categories as <b>image</b>:
  <ul>
  <li> Photos of specimen, experimental set-up, etc (Raw images taken with a hand camera except
  immunoblots and images of gels, which are excluded. A camera raw image file contains minimally
  processed data from the image sensor of either a digital camera, image scanner, or motion
  picture film scanner) </li>
  <li> Microphotographs: Taken of specimen under the microscope with a microscope camera
  (light microscopy, confocal microscopy, light sheet etc.) </li>
  <li> Electron micrographs: Taken with an electron microscope </li>
  <li> Images from clinical imaging techniques: ultrasound, echocardiography, MRI, x-ray,
  e-ray CT, positron emission tomography (PET) </li>
  <li> Other types of images: Infrared images of mice, etc. </li>
  </ul>

  Images may form all or part of any figure or figure panel. </br>

  <p>
  <b>Excluded images: </b> </br>

  Photos of blots (protein - western blot, RNA - northern blot,
  DNA - southern blot, etc.), animations or computer generated images,
  graphic results of computers models and simulations,
  Science Art, drawings, schematic diagrams, molecular models,
  Protein Structure (i.e. ribbon diagrams), graphical abstracts,
  numerical data summarized in tables or graphs.
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Scale information:</b> </br>

  Images without scales are uninterpretable by the audience and of limited use for future
  reference. They are just a piece of (abstract) art. To avoid this, all scientific images
  need scale information. Traditionally the magnification was given as 100x in the figure legend.
  As this requires the reader to basically create the scale bar from scratch in the 50ies the
  scale bar became popular (I believe it started out with EM pictures where 13000x was a little
  annoying).

  A scale bar in one image of a set of images with the same dimension is sufficient; scale
  information should not be considered missing for the remaining images with the same scale
  in that panel or figure. The figure legend does not need to be specified for ALL individual
  images  when it is obvious that all images are meant.
  </p> </br>

  <p>
  <b>Annotation:</b> </br>
  Images where we know the scale but not what is shown are not useful. Therefore, ideally all
  images should have information about the cell type, tissue, animal (or comparable information).
  </p> </br>

  <p>
  <b>Magnification:</b> </br>
  Most images only show a certain frame or angle or part of a specimen, which is necessary to
  make the point. However, is also essential that we are given enough context to judge the whole
  picture.

  Examples: If we are shown an image of a face to say a person is tall, this in not the correct
  frame to choose. Likewise, if we say a person has beautiful eyes but we show a total image of
  her frame, this again is not suitable since we cannot make out the eyes.

  Orientation: We should which side goes up vs. down, i.e. one would not show a person upside
  down in a photograph. When showing a detail, for instance the right eye, one should state where
  in relation to the whole body the image comes from.
  This is essential for specimen and tissues that have axes but irrelevant for cells in culture
  that are growing individually.

  <b>Colors:</b> </br>
  Images can be black/white or colored. Colors can be useful to illustrate necessary information
  or highlight several aspects in parallel (e.g. movement across time; comparative localization
  of 2 proteins at one time point; comparison of protein species to a reference). When using color
  to show information, color should be used effectively such that it is accessible to all audiences
  and clearly labeled.

  Keep in mind: we can discern many more shades of grey (~50,000) than we can discern colors
  (red, bright red, scarlet red, shades of red). If shading is used to convey information, most
  images would be more readable in black and white than a color (i.e. green/black).

  Note if individual channels are shown (image with red channel, images with green channel AND
  a merge, then the merged image is ok as it is shown with the single images next to it).

  <b>Methodological description:</b> </br>
  Key for reproducibility is that the same images could in principle be taken by another
  scientist and replicated. For this, the sample must be clear, the staining/slicing/preparation
  method, but also the technical equipment is important (this is taken care of by journals by
  mandatory methods section, hopefully improved by protocols.io). In the era of electronic
  imaging and deconvolution it is essential that not only the microscope is stated but also
  how the image was captured (often enough these two are very coupled as the microscopes come
  with their own software and the software settings are saved in the meta-file of the image).
  And, with more possibilities of post-image processing, the way the image was adjusted for maybe
  digital evaluation is essential, therefore the image processing pipeline should be available.

  See minimum requirements in the google doc.

  <b>Suitability for next generation:</b> </br>
  It is increasingly clear that in future re-assessing and re-analysing research data from
  repositories will be important, and current developments towards atlases and central image
  storages support this. I would like to see that researchers are moving towards this direction
  by as much as possible already providing images for re-analysis now. Note: images from pdf/jpeg
  compression are NOT reusable for analysis e.g. of intensity post publication. Therefore we can
  only reply on raw-images being deposited along-side the publication in a data storage site.
